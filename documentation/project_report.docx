1. Introduction
FreshMart is a web-based grocery store application designed to simplify grocery shopping for users. The project aims to provide a robust, user-friendly platform for browsing, purchasing, and managing groceries online. The rationale is to address the inconvenience of traditional shopping and offer a modern solution for both customers and shop owners.

2. Literature/Technology Review
The review covers existing e-commerce grocery platforms, their features, and technologies. FreshMart uses PHP, MySQL, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and Bootstrap. Comparative analysis shows FreshMart offers improved user experience, security, and admin management compared to basic online stores.

3. Methodology
The project followed Agile development with regular team meetings, requirement gathering via surveys, and iterative design. Collaborative tools (Google Docs, GitHub) were used for report writing and code management. Requirement collection included interviews with potential users and competitive analysis.

4. Requirement Engineering
Requirements were collected through user surveys and competitor analysis. Functional requirements include user registration, product catalog, cart, checkout, admin panel, and order management. Non-functional requirements cover security, accessibility, and performance. The final specification was documented and used for design.

5. System Design
System design includes:
- Database schema (see database/freshmart_db.sql)
- User interface wireframes
- Class diagrams for backend logic
- Sequence diagrams for user flows
- Navigation structure for frontend

6. Implementation
The system was implemented using PHP for backend, MySQL for database, and Bootstrap for frontend. Key challenges included secure authentication, cart logic, and responsive design. Solutions involved using password hashing, AJAX for cart updates, and media queries for mobile support.

7. Testing/Results
Unit tests were written for backend functions. Integration tests ensured all modules work together. User acceptance testing was performed with sample users. Results show the system meets all functional requirements and is robust under normal usage.

8. Conclusion
FreshMart successfully delivers a modern grocery shopping experience. All aims and objectives were met. The system is scalable and ready for further enhancements.

9. Reflection & Future Work
Each team member contributed to coding, design, and documentation. Key learnings include teamwork, project management, and technical skills. Future work could add mobile app support, advanced analytics, and more payment options.
